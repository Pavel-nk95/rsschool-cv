### Briefly about me:
In the past, he worked as a design engineer of low-current systems.
I have always paid special attention to structuring information and automating work processes.
At the previous place of work, I faced the tasks of writing scripts for a video surveillance system SecurOS, realized that I like writing code more and decided to change the field of activity.
I chose the direction of frontend development because of the desire to learn how to develop interfaces and the ability to instantly see the result of my work.

Goal: to get an offer for the position of Frontend developer.
